  // Supabase stores session data (especially the JWT and user identity info) in a cookie. Sometimes, this data gets too big for a single cookie (max ~4KB), so Supabase will split it into two parts:
  //    part 1 of the token (typically the access token) sb-<project-ref>-auth-token.
  //    part 2 (often identity data, maybe even the refresh token).
  // They work together as one session.

// Itâ€™s the return URI Supabase redirects to after Google signs in the user
// The Supabase client-side session/auth-change listener in the layout only sees the session after that cookie is set
